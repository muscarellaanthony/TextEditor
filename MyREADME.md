# Text Editor

## Description
This is my first project using webpack config to create an app that can be used offline. Text Editor is downloadable and doesn't rely on an internet connection to work. All work added to the editor will be saved and protected. 

## Installation
Use `npm i` to install all of the dependencies and then `npm run start` to host the app locally. Now you can install the app from the broswer with the install button. 

## Usage
Usage is very simple. After hosting the site you can jot down any of your notes, thoughts, or ideas. They will be saved. Use the install button to download the app to your desktop. [See example image here.](./client/src/images/TextEditor.png)
